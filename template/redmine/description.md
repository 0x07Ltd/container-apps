Redmine with PostgrSQL
======================

## System requirements
Recommend 2GB of RAM for your Host and 2 Cores for best performance!

## Setup
The values of environemental variables for both PostgreSQL and Redmine need to match. The Keys cannot change. Also, the aliases used in the links to Posatgres from Redmine cannot change.

If the Redmine service does not start up, try the **Rebuild App** function on the application details page to kick start it. Watch the journal for output.

To view the GUI after launching the template, browse to http://nas.ip:10081.

__NOTE__: Please allow a few minutes for the Redmine service to start.
